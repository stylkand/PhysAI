## ðŸ“‹**Description**

This repository contains the implementation of a mobile App that lets the physiotherapist supervise patient kinetic movements. 

## **Details**
The App takes as input live video frames of the patient doing his workout.
Then a pose estimation neural network is applied so certain keypoints appear on screen real-time.
Finally a smart classification algorithm classifies the workout exercise and computes the number of iterations.
